Welcome to the schelertech `_blog!` I will post things related to running a helpdesk for a medium sized corporation. Here is an example of a line of code for `silently installing` an application using tools like powershell and cmd which are very powerful tools.

Stay tuned for tuned for more `_blog!` posts for helpdesk technicians.

Without further delay here is the first code snippet:

```ruby
msiexec /i sophos-connect.msi /qn
```

Check out the [Schelertech Docs][schelertech.doc] for more info on how to utilize powershell and cmd. If you interested in help, you can book services here [Schelertech Services][schelertech-service].
